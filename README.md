In this project, several steps were taken to analyze user behavior and demographic information. Initially, the missing (NaN) values in the dataset were filled using various imputation techniques, ensuring that the dataset was complete and reliable. After addressing the NaN values, data visualization techniques were applied to understand the overall structure of the dataset.

The analyses focused on examining distributions of variables such as gender, age, country, and purchase amounts, which revealed the demographic and geographic composition of the user base. For instance, the gender distribution charts indicated a balanced user base of both male and female users, while the age distribution showed that young adults, particularly those between 25-30 years old, were more active. Additionally, examining total purchase amounts by country revealed relatively balanced spending across different regions.

These visualizations provided valuable insights into which demographic groups could be targeted in future business strategies and which geographic markets might require more focus. Tailored marketing strategies based on age groups and gender distributions could prove useful for identifying growth opportunities.

Overall, this project has facilitated the correction of data gaps and the extraction of key user insights through visualizations. The findings can be utilized to optimize marketing strategies and gain a better understanding of customer segments, ultimately supporting improved decision-making and business performance.
